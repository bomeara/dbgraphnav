DBGraphNav is a tool to facilitate the browsing of data within relational databases. When integrated into another project, it allows users to view a graphical representation of the relationships between database entries, and to browse them by clicking on a node or connecting line to redraw the graph with a new focal node.

It is designed to be embedded within another project, and displayed to end-users as one of several database navigation techniques. Navigation images are generated with [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) and a database abstraction layer is used to ensure compatibility with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and other major databases.

DBGraphNav 1.0 is now available for [download](http://dbgraphnav.googlecode.com/files/dbgraphnav-1.0.tar.gz).

DBGraphNav is in use at [http://www.TreeTapper.org/](http://www.TreeTapper.org/person/1)

Originally developed by [Paul McMillan](http://thefire.us/) under the mentorship of [Bryan O'Meara](http://www.brianomeara.info/) as part of the Google Summer of Code.
