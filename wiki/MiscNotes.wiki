#summary Miscellaneous project notes.

= Introduction =

Whatever goes here is something that needed to go somewhere.

= Details =
Each call for an image is going to generate a matching image map, and vice versa. We need to cache these so that they don't have to be re-generated by a second query, and can be returned in the same query. We need some kind of request locking to prevent multithreaded attempts to generate the same results. This may actually be a hard problem.

Simple user "setup" app to help test query results

weighted "straight" (or colored) history path?
-causes caching problems
-less of an issue for a low-load app

Write small test app to make sure that php and graphviz are talking

We currently have no plans to write to the database

Instructions on how to embed images/maps so that they don't slow loading of the rest of the page for most users.

Ajax options:
what about a link to the current document using # notation?

= System Requirements =
PHP 5
Database System supported by [Abstraction Layer]
Disk space for temp files
Server fast enough to run graphviz realtime
