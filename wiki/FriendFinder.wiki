#summary Instructions for configuring the connection component of config.xml

The <friend_finder> section of the config file is the configuration for how DBGraphNav builds the graph network. It helps to consult the example file while reading this description.

Each result from the database must have a type. Within this type, you can specify multiple queries which return information on that type:

<query_base>
This query is used when this type of node is the starting node for a graph. It returns the necessary information to display that node. This query should return (at minimum) a single result with the columns value, type, and display_name. Value is the unique (on a per-type basis) database entry ID.
