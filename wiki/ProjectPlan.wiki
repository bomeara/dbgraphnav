    * Is ADOdb the right one?
    * are there newer ones?
    * learn about the chosen one
  * User Survey

June 1-7

  * Design
    * Figure out how to limit the quantity of data retrieved
      * how do we deal with an over-connected node?
        * Should this be user configurable?
    * Think about how best to manage multi-server setups, start documenting this
    * Continue fleshing out below the line view
    * Document choices regarding caching of results, and keeping the cache within a specified size
    * Integration and callback
      * How does the person installing my application get the info back to their application?
      * How is this configured?
      * Will integrators pass their own data through my code, or will it get passed externally?
    * Milestone: Answers to the above questions
  * Figure out how best to make php interact with Graphviz
    * How best to pass the dot file to Graphviz?
    * Should I be piping the file results directly to php?
    * saving them to disk and then reading them?
    * Start figuring out how result caching is going to work
      * Write to file or to DB?
      * Does php write the file?
      * Does graphviz write it?
      * How is it named for easy later retrieval?
    * Milestone: Work out example code for whatever I decide is the best method for interaction
    * Create small test app to test and debug this connection
  * Create working config interface
    * XML config file
    * Read into array
    * PHP "converter" to transform XML -> static php file
----
(The future is below this line)

    * Request handling
    * Database connection
    * database interaction abstractions
  * Begin core application
    * Implement simple integrator interface (probably php config file at this stage)
    * Get SQL queries returning correct data
    * Implement SQL query limiting solution

  * Evaluate next features

July 6-12

  * Bugtesting
  * Integration testing
  * Code cleanup
  * Filling in the cracks, taking stuff from the "cobbled together with ductape" stage to "cleanly functional"


Weekly Tasks:

  * Monday
    * Send project status update to list
      * Accomplishments
      * Goals for next week
  * Friday
    * Extend detailed project plan by at least 1 week
    * Make sure Design Doc is not self-contradictory

= Overview =

-May 26-
Concentrate on design document. Work on solving the the hard problems. (extensibility, limiting the amount of data retrieved, how to handle where links go, how to handle embedding, what configuration options are appropriate?)
Begin coding project framework (basic SQL connections, http interface, etc.).
Get comfortable with coding and working with each of the relevant tools.

-June 9-
Get design doc approval, or develop specific plan to finish areas that still need work.
Start coding core application.

-July 7-
SQL data selection/limitation functional (http requests retrieve the appropriate data from the DB)
Demonstrable progress toward key areas of core functionality:
SQL results->dot file
dot file-> graphic/imagemap
Followup URL generation working properly (i.e. clicking an image actually takes the user to the appropriate next node)
Correct External app URL retrieval (the app interacts correctly with the application it is being used within)

-July 28-
Tentative core project completion date. This includes security against SQL injection attacks.
Begin work on extra non-core features such as the following:
Build AJAX mouseover etc. breakout control code
Write further documentation on modification of the appropriate SQL statements to customize the project for other databases
Improve efficiency/response time, using techniques such as caching and predictive lookup
Design and implement database templating system
Develop working examples for database other frameworks such as CakePHP or BioSQL
Document and implement necessary changes for moving image generation to a different server for first order load balancing
Further configurable options (i.e. links to graphs with more nodes, easy filtering of the data types returned, etc.)

-August 11-
Stop active development of new features.
Finish any in-progress features.
Bug-test, complete documentation.
Work with any initial deployments to improve quality of integration.
